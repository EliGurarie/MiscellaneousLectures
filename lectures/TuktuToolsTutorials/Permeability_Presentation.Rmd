**Caribou** have enormous ranges (esp. .darkred[migratory / barren-ground], but also .darkgreen[boreal / woodland])

Enormous concern about the potential impacts of industrial developments and road building on caribou in particular.

# Example with Boreal Caribou

6 animals around HW1.  **n** crossings out of **N** possible steps.

--

$$\large \widehat{\kappa} = 0.24\,\, (95\%\,\text{C.I.}: 0.13-0.36)$$

**Interpretation:** caribou is 75% less likely to show up on the other side of HW1 than if the road weren't there.

# Main take-aways

- Barriers are important!

- **Permeability** (movement related) & **Habitat Use** (landscape related) measure unique but important properties with (likely) important fitness consequences. 

- The ability to quantify permeability is important for assessing:

  - Success in mitigation for artificial barriers
  - Climate-change related impacts on natural barriers

]

--

.pull-right[

## (Near)-Future work 

- Develop & improve tools for simulataneous **permeability** & **habitat resource** analysis.

- Apply widely!  This kind of analysis has resonance & relevance globally.
